Hey There!

I am interested in building theory and tools to understand and apply Machine Learning.

Currently, I am a second year graduate student in the Computer Science Department at University of Texas, Austin. 

Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering (Hons.) with minor in Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
